  <h2 class='c004'>THE ORIGIN OF THE MASSACHUSETTS MILITIA</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Prior to the outbreak of the Revolution the militia of the Province
of Massachusetts Bay was governed by the provisions of an act for
regulating the militia, passed in 1693. Although quaint and antiquated
in its provisions, it seems to have sufficed for all practical purposes;
and no other act was passed regulating the militia until the Provincial
Congress, almost at the beginning of its sittings, took steps to place the
militia of the Province upon a different basis in order to find themselves
prepared for the impending contest with the mother country, which at that
date, October, 1774, was patent to all men as an unavoidable conflict.</p>

<p class='c009'>It may be interesting to note some of the provisions and requirements
that governed the militia during the Province period under the old act
referred to. The act provided that all male persons from sixteen years
of age to sixty, with certain exceptions, should bear arms and duly attend
all musters and military exercises of the respective troops and companies
wherein they were listed, allowing three months’ time to every son, next
after his coming to sixteen years of age, and to every servant for the same
period after his time was out, to provide themselves with arms, ammunition,
etc. It also provided that, if any person liable to be listed as aforesaid—<i>i.e.</i>,
as a member of any troop or company, in the precinct or town
where he resided—should avoid service by shifting from house to house
or place to place, to avoid being listed as a member of a troop or company,
he should be fined ten shillings for every offence, the money to be paid
over to the company to which he belonged. Regimental musters, except
in Boston, were to be held but once in three years; but the act provided
that every captain, or chief officer, of a company or troop, should draw
forth his company or troop four days annually, and no more; to exercise
them in motions, the use of arms, and shooting at marks, or other military
exercises. The punishment for any disorders or contempt committed by
any member of a company on a training day or on a watch was to be by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>laying neck and heels, riding the wooden horse, or ten shillings’ fine. The
exemptions from training included the members of the Council, the Representatives
for the time being, the Secretary, Justices of the Peace, the
President, Fellows, students, and servants of Harvard College, Masters
of Art, ministers, elders and deacons of churches, sheriffs, physicians,
surgeons, and professed schoolmasters, all such as had held commissions
and served as field officers or captains, lieutenants or ensigns; coroners,
treasurers, the Attorney-General, deputy sheriffs, clerks of courts, constables,
constant ferrymen, and one miller to each gristmill. In addition
there were exempted officers employed in connection with the Crown
Revenue service, all masters of vessels of thirty tons and upwards, constant
herdsmen, persons lame or otherwise disabled in body (on production of
a certificate from two surgeons), Indians and negroes. It also provided
that where any person could not provide his own arms, corn or other
merchantable provision or vendable goods, to the extent of one-fifth part
more than the value of the arms and ammunition, might be proffered
to the clerk of the company, who was authorized to sell it and thus provide
the person with the necessary arms. In case any were too poor
to even supply merchandise, the arms were to be provided from the town
stock. It also provided that a stock of powder and ammunition should
be held in every town, and from time to time be renewed by the Selectmen.
The necessary stock of powder, arms, and ammunition, was to be secured
by a rate equally and justly laid upon the inhabitants and estates in such
towns; and the rate for this purpose was collected by the constables, who
were authorized, in case of non-payment, to distrain as for other rates.
Under this act the militia of the Province were governed, and from the
militia so authorized were raised the troops who formed the contingent of
Provincials in the various expeditions against Canada, and proved their
natural military capacity and their inherent quality as good soldiers at the
siege of Louisburg, the expedition against Crown Point, and upon other
occasions, as well as in various minor engagements with the Indian enemy
upon the eastern and western frontiers of the Province.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the events of the Stamp Act and when it became a certainty
that the colonists could hope for nothing from the tyrannical ministry of
Great Britain, and all thinking men faced the possibility of armed resistance
to the mother country, it became necessary for those foreseeing the
event and in the forefront of the Revolutionary party to provide a more
elastic instrument and one more responsive to their urgent needs than could
be looked for under the old militia act. Accordingly, in the first Provincial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>Congress, on the 26th of October, 1774, a committee appointed to consider
what was necessary to be done for the defence and safety of the Province
made a report upon which a resolve was immediately passed, making provision
for the appointment of a Committee of Safety, who were empowered
and directed to alarm, muster, and cause to be assembled, with the
utmost expedition, such and so many of the militia of the Province, completely
armed and equipped, as they might judge necessary for any contingency
they might be called upon to confront. Provision was made for the
pay and subsistence of any force that might be so assembled, and for the
appointment of general officers, inasmuch as some of the officers holding
commissions under crown appointments might have, and no doubt did
hold, what were at the time conservative opinions concerning the causes
that had led to the bitter feeling between the people of the Colonies and
the ministers of Great Britain. It was resolved that such companies as
had not already chosen officers should do so forthwith; and, where said
officers should judge the districts included within the regimental limits
too extensive, they should divide them and adjust their limits, and proceed
to elect field officers to command the regiments, so called. The effect of
this action, when carried out, was to practically redistrict the whole militia
of the Province, and provide them with company officers and field officers
that were in sympathy with the popular feeling; and this change took effect
upon the initiative of what was practically a convention of delegates from
the people, who had assembled in response to a call to take measures to
save the Province from what they considered violation of their rights and
privileges, and from aggressive militarism.</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE MINUTE-MEN: WHAT THEY WERE</h3>

<p class='c012'>It was at the same time provided that one-quarter, at least, of the
respective companies in every regiment should be formed into companies
of fifty privates at the least, who were to equip and hold themselves in
readiness to march at the shortest notice from the Committee of Safety
upon any emergency. Each company so formed was to choose a captain
and two lieutenants, and they were to be grouped in battalions to consist
of nine companies each and the captains and subalterns of each battalion
were to elect field officers to command them. These were the minute-men,
and were organized under this resolve, nearly six months before the affair
of April 19, 1775; and the promptness with which they assembled in
response to the alarm upon that memorable occasion is thereby accounted
for. The foregoing statement will also serve to explain what has been a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>matter of confusion to many people; namely, the distinction between
minute-men and militia. The minute-men, while of the militia, were, for
a short time at the beginning of the war, a distinct body under a separate
organization. A minute-man was a member of the militia who had engaged
himself, with others, to march at a moment’s warning; while a
militiaman was one who had not so engaged, and yet was equally liable to
be called upon for service, when the Committee of Safety should deem it
necessary to order out the militia. It happened, therefore, that companies
of minute-men and companies of militia from the same town responded
under different commanders to the alarm of April 19, 1775. The service
of one was as patriotic as that of the other; but the minute-men were under
special engagement to hold themselves in readiness to march at a moment’s
warning, and you may assume that they were, as a rule, the youngest, most
active, and most patriotic members of their respective communities.</p>

<p class='c009'>In December, 1774, a patriotic address by the committee on the state
of the Province was accepted by the Provincial Congress, and a copy
thereof sent to all the towns and districts in the Province. In this address
after a recital of the grievances and oppressions laid upon the people, and
of the necessity of guarding their rights and liberties, it was recommended
that particular care should be taken by each town and district to equip
each of the minute-men not already provided therewith with an effective
firearm, bayonet, pouch, knapsack, thirty rounds of ball cartridges and
that they be disciplined three times a week and oftener, as opportunity
might offer. The militia in general were also not to be neglected, and
their improvement in training and drill was strongly recommended. Thus
early before open hostilities were declared did the Provincial Congress of
Massachusetts take prompt and energetic measures to place themselves
upon a military footing, so as not to be taken at a disadvantage when the
shock of armed strife should occur.</p>

<p class='c009'>The second Provincial Congress in February, 1775, confirmed the
powers of the Committee of Safety, to whom all military matters were
directly intrusted, repeated the recommendations of the previous Congress
relative to the militia, and appointed four general officers. The commanding
officer of each regiment of minute-men, as well as the colonels
of the militia regiments, were recommended to review their respective
commands and to make return of their number and equipment. Six days
before the 19th of April the Committee of Safety was authorized to form
six companies of the train artillery already provided by the Colony, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>immediately enter upon a course of discipline and be ready to enter the
service whenever an army should be raised.</p>

<p class='c009'>The events of the historic 19th of April, 1775, brought matters to a
crisis more rapidly than had been anticipated; and, following that incursion
of the British troops (<i>excursion</i> it is sometimes called in the quaint
language of the day, although one would hardly term it a pleasant one),
the Provincial Congress resolved that an army of 13,600 men should be
raised immediately by the Province of Massachusetts Bay. A few days
later it was moved and passed that the companies in each regiment should
consist of fifty-nine men, including three officers, and that each regiment
should consist of ten such companies.</p>

<p class='c009'>The militia and minute-men, as reorganized and prepared in accordance
with the directions of the Provincial Congress, responded with marvelous
promptitude when the call to arms came. Within ten days after
the battle of Lexington between fifteen and twenty thousand men had
assembled at Cambridge and Roxbury. But it was an armed assemblage
rather than an army. There was practically no cohesion beyond the company
organization. They were not accustomed to act with other units as
battalions or regiments. There was no term or limit of service prescribed
or that could be required of these men that came forward in response to
the alarm. Their own patriotic fervor or the persuasiveness of their
officers made the measure of their stay in the service. It was, in consequence,
a fluctuating force from day to day, with arrivals and departures in
constant progress. The problems involved in making it a united or
cohesive force for either aggression or defence would drive the modern
military man frantic. Yet of necessity this force had to serve as the
nucleus of the army it was proposed to raise to serve for eight months or
to December 31, 1775.</p>

<p class='c009'>The method of recruiting seems odd in these days, but in reality it
was simple enough and was effective at the same time. “Beating orders,”
as they were called, were issued to captains and lieutenants, or rather to
those desiring to be commissioned in such capacities; and, upon their securing
the specified number of men agreeing to serve under them, they were
accepted with their men, and their commissions assured to them. In this
way the men practically chose their officers, while at the same time each
officer in a regiment from the colonel down became his own recruiting
officer, captains and lieutenants in order to fill up their company strength,
and colonels in order to obtain their full quota of companies. No commissions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>were issued to any regiment until it was completed. It was this practice
that caused several New Hampshire companies to be embodied in
Massachusetts regiments.</p>

<p class='c009'>The effectiveness of this method of enlistment can best be judged by
the fact, officially verified, that commissions had been issued to the officers
of fifteen regiments, they having at that time the proper complement of
men. It could not be expected, under the conditions that prevailed, that
an army so hastily gotten together and formed from small local organizations,
totally unused to acting in masses under any military system as
regiments or brigades, should have presented, either in the matter of discipline
or equipment, anything that would commend itself to the trained
military man. One thing, however, all those who had assembled, whether
as minute-men or militia, possessed in common; and that was the patriotic
determination to resist by every means in their power any further encroachment
upon their rights and liberties. A goodly number of the recruits
and many of the officers had served in the expeditions against Canada; and
these were sufficient to leaven the mass, and communicate by example and
precept something of the military spirit to their younger comrades who had
never rendered service in the field. At that time the army was a Massachusetts
army, and in fact it is so termed in the official documents. The regiments
were really what would be designated in these days as State regiments,
being enlisted, officered, and maintained entirely by Massachusetts.
There was no lack of officers of the higher grades, as there were provided
in addition to the general officers previously named as having been appointed
in making the establishment for the organization of the army,
May 23, 1775, one lieutenant-general, two major-generals, four brigadier-generals,
two adjutant-generals, and two quartermaster-generals.</p>

<p class='c009'>By June 13, 1775, it had been resolved that twenty-three regiments
should be commissioned, exclusive of one regiment of artillery, which latter
was to consist of ten companies, and had already been partly organized.
Such were the constituent parts of the army organized by Massachusetts
inside of two months after the 19th of April, 1775, from her local
militia; and it was these same raw and undisciplined levies, assisted by the
contingents from the neighboring Colonies, which had assembled at Cambridge
and Roxbury upon news being conveyed to them that Massachusetts
had accepted the gage of battle, who time after time repelled the attacks
of picked regiments of troops of Great Britain, until compelled to leave
the field by lack of ammunition upon the seventeenth day of June, 1775.
No better test of the mettle of the American militiaman, when converted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>into a soldier, can be conceived than was furnished upon that day when
a number of these hastily organized regiments met and shrank not from
the attack of trained soldiers. Although, naturally enough, regarded as a
defeat, and, therefore, in a measure discreditable to the provincials, so
much so that in after years veteran survivors cared not to exploit their participation
in the battle, it really had a tremendous moral effect upon each
side, the provincials being assured thereafter that under anywhere near
like equal conditions they could defeat the British, while for the enemy
there resulted the enforced conviction that the colonists were not unworthy
foes, and that like victory would be altogether too dearly bought.</p>

<p class='c009'>The encouragement offered to men to enlist into the eight months’
service would hardly be considered in the light of a very extravagant
bounty in these days. The Provincial Congress provided that a woollen
coat should be supplied to every soldier who enlisted, in addition to his
wages and travel allowance. These coats were to be provided by the different
towns throughout the Province; and a schedule was made up, allotting
a definite number to be furnished by each town. They were to be of
a uniform pattern, as far as the style of the coat was concerned; but
apparently the only distinctive military attachment in connection with them
was the buttons, which it was enacted should be of pewter and bear the
regimental number, when the coats were distributed to the men belonging
to the different organizations. It may well be imagined that this method
of securing coats did not result in very prompt delivery, and in consequence
it was provided later in the year that soldiers might receive a money equivalent
for the value of the coat. Inasmuch as many of the men served the
full term of their enlistment without ever being gratified with the sight of
the promised bounty coat, it is not to be wondered at that thousands of
them accepted the money equivalent, and received it in some instances after
the expiration of their term of service. With the appointment of Washington
as commander-in-chief by the Continental Congress, the Massachusetts
army, raised as I have described, together with the levies raised
by the other Colonies, became a part of the Continental establishment. The
eight months’ men raised by Massachusetts can properly be regarded
accordingly as Continental soldiers, although originally raised under State
auspices, without any outside encouragement or assistance. The actual
transfer of State stores, supplies, etc., did not take place for some little
time after Washington had taken command at Cambridge; and many of
the officers exercised the duties of their positions under their State commissions,
and did not receive Continental commissions until September or
October, 1775.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>It may be interesting to note how the effective forces at Washington’s
disposition compared with the authorized number directed to be raised by
the Provincial Congress of Massachusetts. They had provided for an
army of 13,600 men; but on July 10, 1775, Washington expressed his concern
at finding the army inadequate to the general expectation and the
duties which might be required of it. In this communication he states
that the number of men fit for duty of the forces raised by the Province,
including all the outposts and artillery, did not amount to 9000. He also
states that the troops raised in the other Colonies were more complete,
although they also fell short of their establishment; and his estimate at
that time of the total number of men at his disposition available for duty
was not more than 13,500. The proportion, however, of the troops furnished
by the different Colonies, and composing the army that invested
Boston, is shown by a general return, signed by Adjutant-General Horatio
Gates in July, 1775. It gives twenty-six Massachusetts regiments (an
additional regiment not being completed is not included in the number),
four independent companies, also of Massachusetts, with a regiment of
artillery, three Connecticut regiments, three New Hampshire regiments,
three Rhode Island regiments, and a Rhode Island company of artillery,
making altogether a total force of 17,355 men.</p>

<p class='c009'>At a council of war, July 9, 1775, it was estimated that the force of
the enemy amounted to 11,500, and that the army investing Boston ought
to consist of at least 22,000 men; and it was recommended, in order to
supply the deficiency, that an officer from each company raised in Massachusetts
Bay should be sent out to recruit all the regiments up to their
standard efficiency as fixed by the Provincial Congress, Rhode Island and
Connecticut being at the time engaged in recruiting for the purpose of
filling up their quotas of troops to the full establishment. Naturally
enough, the commander-in-chief found much to lament over in the
deficiencies both as to number and equipment of the army he found
almost ready made to his hand, and yet so lacking in all things from a
military point of view; but there is little of criticism in his letters of the
period, although they are filled with pleadings, expostulations, and exhortations
for the purpose of bringing up the army to a desired state of
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c009'>While the enlisted men comprising this eight months’ army held the
line and were being brought more or less under military discipline and
system, there were times when their numbers fell short of the estimated
number required for a besieging army, where it was at any time possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>that the enemy equal in effective force might make an attack and break the
line. It was found necessary from time to time to call forth the local
militia from the towns in the vicinity of Boston to do duty for longer or
shorter periods; but then, as later, the general officers criticised the efficiency
of the militia thus called upon, as they could not be depended upon for
a continuance in camp for any definite period, or regularity and discipline
during the time they might stay. Such criticism was inevitable, and was
applied during the whole term of the Revolutionary War to the militia
contingents that were called forth in all the Colonies by the officers commanding
the regulars or the Continental forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>After the expiration of the term of service of the eight months’ men
a call was made for twelve months’ men; and many of those who served
the first term or first campaign, as it was called, both officers and men,
engaged for the second campaign. The organization of the standing
militia thereby became broken up and disrupted by the depletion of the
local organizations. It therefore became necessary to make a reorganization
and redistricting of the militia of the Province. An act was accordingly
passed January 22, 1776, by which this object was attained. It provided
that all able-bodied male persons from sixteen years of age to fifty,
with certain specified exemptions, in every town and district should be considered
members of the train band. The alarm list should consist of all
male persons from sixteen years of age to sixty-five, not liable to be included
in the train band and not exempted under special provision. Each
company was to consist of sixty-eight privates, exclusive of the alarm list,
officered by a captain and two lieutenants, non-commissioned officers to be
four sergeants, four corporals, with a drummer and fifer for each company.
A brigadier-general was directed to be chosen for each county, and
under him the field officers of the different regiments were authorized to
divide up and district the regiments, each regiment having a colonel, lieutenant-colonel,
and two majors. Three major-generals were also to be
chosen by the Council or House of Representatives. Under this enactment
the county regiments were numbered, officered, and their organizations
established, and from the standing militia thus provided for all detachments
and drafts of Massachusetts militia that were made, either for
short terms of service upon alarms or as re-enforcements to the Continental
Army, were made during the remaining period of the war. This establishment
for the militia continued in force until after the adoption of the
State Constitution in 1780.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A BIT OF CHURCH HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>It is a subject of hope that someone—perhaps he is already cooing in
his cradle and smiling in response to the wondering faces that bend
over him—will be inspired to embody in imperishable epic, the adventurous
deeds of the Puritan and Pilgrim Fathers in the New World. He
must be a child of the Muses. He must have insight to sound the deeper
currents of human motive and action, the instinct for dramatic situations,
a feeling for the concrete in choice and act, and for the individual man.
When that epic appears some cantos of it will relate to the settlements of
the Connecticut valley, and among these old Windsor, to the ancient church
in which place this brief article relates.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are fortunate in having a memoir of Captain Roger Clapp, a
young man of the company, written expressly for his own descendants, with
glowing religious purpose, but in more than one particular illuminating
upon the history and spirit of that early enterprise. Mr. Clapp’s own case
is a fine exhibition of the process of selection and unification by which a
party was made up of such as were fitted to undertake together the peculiar
task of making a new community in the wilderness. One would readily
guess that the relations of the individuals of such a company must be somewhat
other than those secured by formal agreements and contracts on
paper. They must be bound together by the finest of affinities, by mutual
esteem, by the strength of commanding leadership. Add to this, of course,
a rugged sense of the call and providence of God. Something of this sort
would be essential to business success, not to say social happiness in the
communal life of a new settlement; and if what Mr. Clapp says of himself
is at all representative, such was actually the case. When a youth, evidently
wishing to be self-supporting, he asked leave of his father to live
“abroad,” and went to live on trial, three miles from Exeter (England).
In his own language: “We went every Lord’s-Day into the City, where
were many famous preachers of the Word of God. I then took such a
liking unto the Revd. Mr. John Warham, that I did desire to live near
him: So I removed (with my Father’s consent) into the city, and lived
with one Mr. Mossiour, as famous a Family for Religion as ever I knew;&#160;...
I never so much as heard of New England until I heard of many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>godly Persons that were going there, and that Mr. Warham was to go
also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Through Mr. Clapp’s personal history we can see in his account of
the organization of the church, how here and there the preparatory process
had been going on in individual lives, and often unconsciously to themselves
men had been getting ready for this joint venture into the New
World. I give his account of the organization somewhat fully: “I
came out of Plymouth in Devon, the 20th of March, and arrived at Nantasket
the 30th of May 1630. Now this is further to inform you, that
there came <i>Many Godly Families</i> in that ship: We were of Passengers
many in Number (besides Sea-men) of good Rank: Two of our Magistrates
come with us, viz., Mr. Rossiter and Mr. Ludlow. These godly
People resolved to live together; and therefore as they had made choice
of these two Revd. Servants of God, Mr. John Warham and Mr. John
Maverick to be their Ministers, so they kept a solemn Day of Fasting in
the New Hospital in Plymouth in England, spending it in Preaching and
Praying: where that worthy Man of God, Mr. John White of Dorchester
in Dorset was present, and Preached unto us the Word of God, in the forepart
of the Day, and in the latter part of the Day, as the People did
solemnly make choice of, and call those godly Ministers to be their Officers,
so also the Revd. Mr. Warham and Mr. Maverick did accept thereof, and
expressed the same. So we came, by the good Hand of the Lord, through
the Deeps comfortably; having Preaching or Expounding of the Word
of God every Day for Ten Weeks together, by our Ministers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This little Israel, which came over the waters, one hundred and forty
strong, in the good ship <i>Mary and John</i>, a craft of 400 tons, were forced
by Capt. Squeb, contrary to his agreement, to disembark in a forlorn place
on Nantasket Point. A place of settlement was soon selected and named
Dorchester. Attracted by the rich Connecticut meadows, five years later
Mr. Warham and the larger portion of his flock made the difficult overland
journey thither, and settled in the beautiful region which was afterwards
called Windsor by “order of the court.” Thus the First Church of
Christ in Windsor goes back beyond Dorchester to Plymouth in Old England,
and has had a continuous existence from March 20, 1630, to the
present as a Congregational Church of what may be called, for lack of a
better term, the orthodox or Trinitarian variety—a fact that can be
affirmed of no other Congregational Church on the American Continent.</p>

<p class='c009'>To speak of the members of this church and their numerous descendants,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>would take us beyond the limits of this article. A few names will
suggest the significance of this body of Christians on the banks of the
Connecticut, in the life of the nation. Matthew Grant, the clerk of the
church and the town, whose fine records are now in the town clerk’s office,
was the ancestor of Gen. U. S. Grant and the numerous clans of the Grant
family in this country. The hero of Manila Bay is a descendant of
Thomas Dewey, of the old Windsor church. Henry Wolcott, a man of
wealth and social importance in old England, was the ancestor of the
famous Wolcott family, which included two Connecticut governors and
men of note in every generation to the present day. Roger Ludlow, the
lawyer of the settlement, gave legal shape to the democracy of Thomas
Hooker in the Constitution of Connecticut, the first written instrument of
the kind on record. Captain John Mason led the federated colonists to
the number of eighty men against the Pequots, and by no means least,
Esther Warham, the youngest daughter of the minister, a woman of rare
charm and remarkable gifts, was the mother of a mighty race, which has
been distinguished by many illustrious names, chief among whom must be
named her grandson, Jonathan Edwards. Two other men of national
renown in quite different directions are Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth and
Edward Rowland Sill. Ellsworth was born in Windsor, lived here practically
his whole life save, of course, when he was away on public business,
and his home still remains, now the property of the Connecticut Society of
the D. A. R. He was a devoted member of the church and chairman of
the building committee in charge of the erection of the new house of
worship in 1794, which still remains in excellent condition. The book
containing, among many others, Mr. Ellsworth’s subscription of 100
pounds, with that for like amounts by Dr. Chaffee and Jerijah Barber, is in
possession of the present treasurer. Edward Rowland Sill, the rare
quality of whose poetic genius has won increasing recognition ever since
his early death, was a descendant of Rev. David Rowland, one of the old
Windsor pastors, and was, by immediate family connections as well as the
associations of his own boyhood, a child of the Windsor church, though he
spent the larger part of his mature life elsewhere.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ARNOLD AND MONTGOMERY AT QUEBEC</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The last day of December, 1904, was the 128th anniversary of the
unsuccessful attack on Quebec in 1775, and by a coincidence on
almost that very day the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec
erected two bronze tablets to commemorate the event. We are indebted
to Mr. F. C. Würtele, the Secretary of the Society, for the photographs
from which our two illustrations are made—they thus appearing in our
pages in advance even of Canadian journals.</p>

<p class='c009'>From the newspaper accounts furnished us, we condense:</p>

<p class='c009'>When the Canadian Government erected monuments on the battlefields
of 1812, the invasion of 1775 seemed to have been forgotten, and no
memorials were placed in Quebec to commemorate the signal defeat of the
Continental invaders on the 31st of December, 1775, at the hands of
General Guy Carleton, the savior of Canada to the British Crown.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, that brave defence has not been forgotten by Quebec’s
citizens, and some time ago at a meeting of the Literary and Historical
Society of Quebec, it was resolved, “That the time has come for the
erection of historic tablets at Pres-de-Ville and the Sault-au-Matelot, in
the lower town of Quebec, relating to the events of 31st of December,
1775, so important to the destiny of Canada; and as it is within the province
of the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec to erect such
memorials, a committee is hereby appointed on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As such memorials would be battlefield monuments, the Federal Government
was petitioned by the society for means to erect suitable historic
tablets at these places. The request was graciously responded to and
splendid memorials in statuary bronze have been erected, one bolted to the
rock where at its base Montgomery was defeated and killed, and the other
on the St. James street gable of the Molsons Bank, as near as possible to
the site of the Sault-au-Matelot barricade, where Arnold was defeated, and
over 400 of his men made prisoners, both events taking place in the early
morning of that memorable last day of December, 1775. As these bronzes
have been placed in position for the anniversary of that event, a short
historic retrospect may be interesting:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>One hundred and twenty-nine years have passed since a force under
Montgomery was sent by Lake Champlain to attack Montreal, and
another under Arnold marched from Cambridge, Mass., via the Voyageur
trail up the Kennebec river and across to the source of the river Chaudiere,
to St. Marie and thence by road to Levis opposite Quebec, where, after
considerable hardships throughout the whole journey it arrived, and crossing
the St. Lawrence appeared on the present Cove Fields, on the 14th,
was fired on and soon retired to Pointe aux Trembles, where the arrival of
Montgomery from Montreal was waited.</p>

<p class='c009'>Montgomery carried all before him, taking Sorel, Montreal and
Three Rivers. General Carleton, who was in Montreal, knowing the
importance of Quebec, and that for divers reasons Montreal could not
then be defended, destroyed the government stores and arrived at Quebec
on the 19th of November, where Colonel MacLean, who had preceded
him, was preparing for its defence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The defences were strengthened and barricades erected and armed in
the Lower Town, in Sault-au-Matelot street, and the present Sous-le-Cap,
also at Pres-de-Ville, where is now the Allan Steamship Company’s
property.</p>

<p class='c009'>Montgomery arrived on the 1st of December with his army, and
Arnold’s 800 raised the attacking force to 2000 men, who proceeded to
take possession of St. Roch’s and erected batteries on the high ground,
Montgomery issued general orders on the 15th December, which were
sent into the town, and a copy is now to be found in the Dominion Archives
at Ottawa:</p>

<p class='c014'>The General having in vain offered the most favorable terms of accommodation
to the Governor and having taken every possible step to
prevail on the inhabitants to desist from seconding him in his wild scheme
of defence, nothing remains but to pursue vigorous measures for the
speedy reduction of the only hold possessed by the Ministerial troops in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Province. The troops flushed with continual success, confident of the
justice of their cause and relying on that Providence which has uniformly
protected them will advance to the attack of works incapable of being
defended by the wretched garrison posted behind them, consisting of
sailors unacquainted with the use of arms, of citizens incapable of the
soldier’s duty and a few miserable emigrants. The General is confident a
vigorous and spirited attack must be attended with success. The troops
shall have the effects of the Governor, garrison, and of such as have been
acting in misleading the inhabitants and distressing the friends of liberty,
to be equally divided among them, each to have the one hundredth share
out of the whole, which shall be at the disposal of the General and given
to such soldiers as distinguished themselves by their activity and bravery,
and sold at public auction. The whole to be conducted as soon as the city
is in our hands and the inhabitants disarmed.</p>

<p class='c009'>The division which was to attack Pres-de-Ville assembled at 2 o’clock
<span class='fss'>A. M.</span> of the 31st December, at Montgomery’s headquarters, Holland
House (now the property of Frank Ross, Esq.), and headed by Montgomery,
marched across the Plains of Abraham and descended into the
beach path, now Champlain street. Those who were to make the attack
by the suburbs of St. Roch, headed by Arnold, were about 800 strong.
The plan was that Montgomery and Arnold were to meet at the foot of
Mountain Hill and storm the Upper Town.</p>

<p class='c009'>A heavy northeast snowstorm was raging at 4 o’clock that dark
morning when Montgomery had descended the cliff and advanced along
the narrow beach path, a ledge flanked to the left by the perpendicular
cliffs of Cape Diamond and to the right by a precipitous descent at whose
base flowed the tide of the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Pres-de-Ville barricade and the blockhouse at the narrowest part
of the road was defended by Captain Chabot, Lieut. Picard, 30 Canadian
militiamen, Captain Barnesfare and 15 seamen, Sergeant Hugh McQuarters,
of the Royal Artillery, with several small guns, and Mr. John Coffin,
50 in all. The garrison was alert and saw the head of the column approach
and halt some fifty yards from the barricade, when a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>approached to reconnoitre, and on his return the column continued its advance,
when it was fired on by cannon and musketry, whose first discharge
killed Montgomery, his aides Macpherson and Cheeseman, and 10 men.
Thereupon the rest of the 700 men turned and fled, pursued by the bullets
of the Canadians till there was nothing more to fire at. None behind the
leading sections knew what happened, and the slain, left as they fell, were
buried by the drifting snow, whence their frozen bodies were dug out later
in the day.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arnold’s column carried the barricade across Sous-le-Cap street, situated
beneath the Half-Moon battery, and were stopped at the second barricade
at the end of that narrow street (quite close to where is now Molsons
Bank), defended by Major Nairne, Dambourges and others, who held
them in check until Captain Laws’ strong party, coming from Palace
Gate, took them in rear and caused their surrender, 427 in all, thus completing
the victory of that morning. Arnold was put out of action early
in the fight by a ball<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c015'><sup>[1]</sup></a> from the ramparts near Palace Gate, when passing
with the leading sections, and was carried to the General Hospital.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>A “SCRUB-POETICAL” ANSWER TO A GOVERNOR</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>His Excellency Jonathan Belcher, governor of His Majesty’s provinces
of Massachusetts and New Hampshire, must have many
times realized what a very difficult and disagreeable task it is to
drive an ill-matched team, especially when one of them is to all appearances
possessed of the Evil One, and the pole is loose and not to be depended
on. Such a team the governor had in his two provinces, and he was a
very busy man.</p>

<p class='c009'>Massachusetts kept well in the traces and gave him comparatively
little trouble. He lived in Boston, and was thus able to maintain a more
intimate knowledge of the people of that State and the trend of public
opinion than was possible to do in respect to more distant New Hampshire,
where he was relatively a stranger. Though not popular as a man or as a
Crown official, his personal presence in Massachusetts as governor, with
the miniature court, the sumptuous appointments, and the dignity which
accompanied the King’s commission, necessarily had some effect in steadying
the progress of government there.</p>

<p class='c009'>But in New Hampshire he had many serious problems. A small
province both in population and resources, it had for many years stood
between Massachusetts and the savages, who were continually hovering
about the frontiers, and in this almost constant warfare, and by the costly
vigilance which was necessary even in times of nominal peace, the province
had incurred debts which were a heavy burden on the sparse population.
During the time in which New Hampshire was considered by the Crown
not of sufficient size, wealth, and importance to maintain a governor of its
own, and accordingly yoked with Massachusetts, the power of granting
townships in New Hampshire was, of course, vested in the governor, and
exercised by him under the same royal instructions as in Massachusetts.
The plans and purposes of the government in locating these grants in New
Hampshire are easily seen by their peculiar but systematic location. They
were largely laid out in lines, each line of towns answering a specific
purpose. One line followed the Merrimack river, Amherst, Bedford,
and Goffstown, guarding the west bank of the main inland waterway of
the two provinces. Another line, Concord, Hopkinton, Henniker, Hillsborough,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Warner, and Bradford, formed a northern frontier, and connected
the Merrimack with Washington and Lempster the most northerly
of another line, the Monadnock townships, which, nine in number, established
a perfect connection back to the Massachusetts line. Still another
line, Chesterfield, Westmoreland, Walpole, and Charlestown, guarded the
east bank of the Connecticut. All these established and maintained a
protection for the whole of central Massachusetts against any incursions
of the Indians from the north, and enclosed large tracts of very valuable
land.</p>

<p class='c009'>The burden of the taxation necessary to pay the expenses of Indian
warfare and maintain the government rested heavily on the people of New
Hampshire, while they were engaged in conflict with the wilderness, planting
the standard of civilization step by step further north and west. Therefore,
when the governor in his recurring messages constantly besought
the Assembly to raise money—to supply funds for repairing Fort William
and Mary, for building a new prison or repairing the old one, for the
expenses of carrying on the boundary line controversy with Massachusetts—he
did not always meet with a cordial reception or a courteous reply.
Money for current expenses and paying old obligations as fast as possible
the Assembly was willing to provide, but little was to be had for other
purposes which did not appear to its members absolutely and urgently
necessary.</p>

<p class='c009'>A strong opposition to the administration sprang up in New Hampshire,
and manifested itself in an intrigue to procure the governor’s recall.
The opposition was headed by Lieutenant-Governor Dunbar, a pugnacious
Irishman, and Theodore Atkinson and Benning Wentworth, who had been
appointed councillors through the efforts of Dunbar, but whose admission
to the council board Governor Belcher prevented for two years. It was
a strong combination. Dunbar was not possessed of great influence with
the home government aside from that which pertained to his office, but
Wentworth and Atkinson had powerful friends and connections in England,
who were not slow to take advantage of Governor Belcher’s increasing
unpopularity both in America and England. So successful were they,
that when, in 1741, the royal decision on the boundary line was carried
into effect, and New Hampshire finally freed from union with Massachusetts,
Wentworth was commissioned governor of the province and
Atkinson became secretary of the council, equivalent to the present office
of secretary of state.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>Governor Belcher was not, however, without friends in New Hampshire,
and the chief of these, perhaps, was Richard Waldron, then secretary
of the council. They were intimate friends, both officially and personally,
and maintained a lively correspondence. Entirely different in
character and disposition, the oddities of each attracted and amused the
other. The governor’s peppery temper gave Waldron many a chance for
a jest or a clever and good-natured retort. But his friends were too few,
and the opposition too strong, and the settlement of the long-disputed
boundary line gave the home government an opportunity too attractive to
be lost for reestablishing the governments of the two provinces on a basis
of complete separation, intended to result in a lasting peace, and the relief
of the Board of Trade and Plantations from continual complaints and the
burden of discussion and decision of what, to them, were but petty provincial
squabbles.</p>

<p class='c009'>This was, in brief, the general atmosphere of the provinces when Governor
Belcher went to New Hampshire to meet the Assembly in the winter
of 1733–4, and there delivered his regular speech and scolded on his
regular subjects. That he was not considered seriously by all the inhabitants
was not due to any lack of earnestness on his part. The author
of the poetical reply has not yet been ascertained. Suspicion, however,
points to Richard Waldron. The handwriting resembles his, but cannot
be certainly identified.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the first century of the life of the province no family was
more prominent or carried a larger influence in the public affairs of New
Hampshire than the Waldrons. Whatever may be said of peculiar characteristics
which were displayed by some members of the family, the early
Waldrons were, as a rule, strong, hard-headed pioneers, the type of men
most needed in subduing a hostile wilderness. Later generations became
wealthy, and wealth brought to them education and refinement, as brains
brought distinction, both civil and military.</p>

<p class='c009'>Secretary Richard Waldron, whom we assume to be the author of the
reply to Governor Belcher’s message, was the son of Richard, and grandson
of Major Richard, who was killed by the Indians at Dover in 1689,
and was born Feb. 21, 1693–4. He was graduated from Harvard in
1712, and soon removed from Dover to Portsmouth. He was a member
of the Governor’s council, Secretary of the province, and Judge of Probate.
It is to the burning of his house in 1736 that we may charge a considerable
loss of the early New Hampshire archives and records, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>breaks in the records which were thus created are serious obstacles to the
historian of the present day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The friendship of Governor Belcher kept Waldron in his office of
Secretary until the end of the Belcher administration, but Governor Wentworth
suspended him from the council, and removed him from the offices
of Secretary and Judge of Probate. In 1749 he was elected Speaker of
the House, which the Governor refused to allow, and a controversy was
created which lasted three years. He died soon after, August 23, 1753.</p>

<p class='c009'>The original manuscript of his “Scrub Poetry” is on file with the
Governors’ messages in the archives in the office of the Secretary of State
at Concord, N. H.</p>

<p class='c009'>On the second day of January, 1733–4, the governor thus addressed
the Council and House of Representatives:</p>

<p class='c014'>Upon my meeting of the Ass<sup>m</sup> of the Mass<sup>ts</sup> Bay in April last I

had been done in this Province) for putting a stop (at present) to any
process in the Law ag<sup>t</sup> the Borderers on the disputed Lines of the two
Provinces. But the Publick Prints have long Since told you it had not the
desired Success.</p>

<p class='c014'>In January Last, I wrote verry fully to the Right Hon<sup>ble</sup> the Lords

<p class='c009'>[An explanation here seems necessary, beyond the possibilities of a
foot-note.</p>

<p class='c009'>March 6, 1732–3, the House passed a bill for emitting £20,000 in
paper money. The province was much in debt on account of Indian warfare,
repairing and maintaining fortifications, etc., and provision for payment
of this debt had been made by heavy taxes to continue annually until
1742. But money was very scarce, and the House considered that the
people would be unable to pay the taxes laid upon them for the want of a
proper medium. Therefore this £20,000 was to be placed in the hands
of a committee, to be loaned to the people at 5% interest for sixteen years,
and the principal of each loan was to be paid at the rate of 25% each year
for the four years next following the term of sixteen years for which the
loan was made. And for the supply of the treasury for the time before
the first interest payment was due, a further sum of £1,000 was to be
issued. The council, however, was unanimous in refusing to concur with
the House on this bill.</p>

<p class='c009'>The House attempted to bring about a compromise by reducing the
loan term to eight years and by other changes in the original bill, but was
not successful, the Governor claiming that the approval of such a bill
would be contrary to his instructions.</p>

<p class='c009'>Finally, March 9, the House addressed a message to the Governor,
in which the council is charged with saying that the House had nothing to
do with the matter of issuing money; and the House further defends its
action and position thus: “Now this House thinks they have and ought
to have a vote in the disposall of all Publick money and that the Board
were formerly of this opinion appears by their Sending down Mr. Atkinson’s
account to be past upon in the last Sessions. So that, that money is
Still unapplyed notwithstanding the Said Atkinson hath declared his readiness
to pay the Same. So that the House can See no other way of Supplying
the Treasury without oppressing the People whome we Represent than
what they have come into. Wherefore this House are humbly of opinion
that it will greatly tend to the Prosperity and welfare of his Maj<sup>ties</sup> Subjects
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>of this Province to address his Maj<sup>tie</sup> by the hand of our agent to
obtaine his Royall leave for a further Emission of Paper Currency more
Especially Since your Excell<sup>y</sup> has informed this House that you cant consent
to. It being contrary to his Maj<sup>ties</sup> Royal Instruction to your Excell<sup>y</sup>
and if the Hon<sup>ble</sup> Council Should think proper to appoint a com’ittee to
Joyne with a Com’ittee of this House for the Ends aforesaid we are humbly
of Opinion it would be attended with the desired effect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The next day, March 10, the council sent down a sharp and angry
reply, as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whereas in a Mess<sup>a</sup> from the Hon<sup>ble</sup> House to his Excellency the
forenoon bearing date the 9th Curr<sup>t</sup> &#38; Sent up this day and communicated
to the Council There are Sundry things mentioned which Seem to cast an
Odium on the Council as tho it lay at their door that there is not a due
Supply of the Treasury to which the Council in justice to themselves are
oblidged to Say that the reason of their non-concurrence to the 20000£
Bills on Loan was (as the House has been Heretofore once and againe
Informed) because the Emission of Bills on Loan is directly contrary to
his Maj<sup>tie</sup> Royal Instructions And as to the thousand pounds Mentioned
for the im’ediate Supply of the Treasury it was couched in the Twenty
thousand pound Bills from whence tis plaine that the House never intended
one Should pass without the other but that if the thousand pounds
for the Supply of the Treasury would not tempt the Council to break this
the Kings Instruction their complyance with the Kings Instruction Should
defeat the Supply of the Treasury but if they had a Sincere disposition to
Supply the Treasury as they pretended and Sent up a Bill for the Same
they would have soon seen the heartiness of the Council in doing their
Duty to his Maj<sup>tie</sup> and the utmost Justice to this Province by the rediest
concurrence as to the Interest of the 1730£ the Council have been long
Endeavouring that that Loan Might by some means or other be beneficial
to the Publick Tho to their great grief by the disappointment of their
attempts in the Honb<sup>ble</sup> House Private psons have enjoyed the benefit of
that money at 2½ p Ct when there have been many that would gladly have
given more than double yea treble for the same if they might have been
favoured with it and the Council have this day Sent down a vote for the
Setting that Loan at 6 p C<sup>t</sup> for 2 years instead of 2½ p Ct in order to Ease
the Tax of the Province which has at last Succeeded as to the Money in

  <h2 class='c004'>HAS GOVERNOR LOVELACE OF NEW YORK BEEN PROPERLY IDENTIFIED?</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>I am not sufficiently acquainted with the details of historical investigation
in New York to know whether there has ever been any doubt as
to the identity (or rather the family) of Governor Lovelace; but I
presume that the Dictionary of National Biography gives the generally
accepted account when it states that he was the second son of Richard, first
Baron Lovelace.</p>

<p class='c009'>Recently the examination of some old documents has led me to the
belief that the Governor of New York was of a much more distinguished
kinship than that which has been usually assigned to him. To most of us
the Lords Lovelace are only known by a passing reference in Macaulay;
but the author of the two songs to Althea and Lucasta is one of the
immortals.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a volume in the Congressional Library, which was bought from
President Jefferson and which contains copies of miscellaneous historical
records relating to Virginia, are two documents signed by Francis Lovelace,
Governor of New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first of these is a letter evidently written to Governor Berkeley of
Virginia. It is as follows:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c013'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>This also had been copied into the Virginia records and attested by
Awborne.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the present discussion this last paper is valuable as proving that
the writer of the letter to Berkeley was certainly Governor Lovelace of
New York.</p>

<p class='c009'>The chain of evidence which appears to contradict the commonly
accepted statement in regard to Governor Lovelace’s family begins with
the pedigree of a family of Gorsuch in the Visitation of London, 1633–4.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>(Harleian Society, p. 327.) In this pedigree it is stated that John Gorsuch,
rector of Walkhome, Hertfordshire, 1633, married Anne, daughter
of Sir William Lovelace, of Kent, Knight, and had the following children
at the time of the visitation: 1. Daniel “about 4a<sup>o</sup> 1633”; 2. John; 3.
William; 4. Cathrin.</p>

<p class='c009'>On April 1st, 1657, Richard, Robert and Charles Gorsuch, sons and
co-heirs of John Gorsuch, “P’fessor in Divinity,” petitioned the Court of
Lancaster County, Va., that their sister Katherine Whitby might be their
guardian for “such estate as doth in any ways belong to them in England,”
and that Francis Moryson [afterwards governor of Virginia] be
their guardian for Virginia. Shortly afterwards all of these boys removed
to the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The records of that colony
not only make notice of them, but also show that they had another brother
Lovelace Gorsuch, and a sister Anne, who married Thomas Todd, of
Mockjack (now Mobjack) Bay, Gloucester County, Va.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Quaker records of West River, Maryland, contain the records of
the marriage, in 1690, of Charles Gorsuch, “son of John and Anne Gorsuch,
of the Kingdom of England, deceased,” and Anne Hawkins. In
1669, Charles and Lovelace Gorsuch confirmed title to certain land which
had been granted to Lovelace Gorsuch in 1661. On Jan. 13, 1676–7,
Mrs. Anne Todd made a deed to her children and appointed her brother,
Chas. Gorsuch, trustee. It seems certain that that John Gorsuch, the
“P’fessor in Divinity,” was identical with Rev. John Gorsuch of Walkhome,
who married Anne, daughter of Sir William Lovelace, of Kent,
and that one of his daughters, Ruth, married William Whitby, of Virginia,
while another, Anne, married Thomas Todd, of the same colony.
This explains at once why Thomas Todd was appointed, as stated by
Governor Lovelace, guardian to William Whitby, Jr. Young Whitby
was the nephew of Todd’s wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>When these facts are made clear the rest of the identification of Governor
Lovelace seems easy. Sir William Lovelace, of Kent, the father of
Mrs. Anne Gorsuch, was also the father of Richard Lovelace, the poet.
The other sons of Sir William were “Col. Francis” (of “Lucasta”),
Thomas and Dudley. The Dictionary of National Biography only knows
of Col. Francis Lovelace, that he served the Royalist Cause in Wales and
commanded Caermarthen from June, 1664, until it was captured by Langhorne
in October, 1645. From Governor Lovelace’s friendship with
Berkeley it seems very probable that it was indeed he (and not the son of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Lord Lovelace as stated in the D. N. B.) who received license from the
Council in 1650 to go to Virginia, and who in May, 1652, was sent by
Berkeley to inform Charles II. of the surrender of Virginia to the Parliamentary
forces.</p>

<p class='c009'>Francis Lovelace and the members of the Gorsuch family evidently
came in the large royalist emigration to Virginia during the Civil War.</p>

<p class='c009'>In conclusion it may be worth while to trace Governor Lovelace’s
kinsman and protégé, William Whitby.</p>

<p class='c009'>William Whitby, the elder, the husband of Ruth Gorsuch, lived in
Warwick County, Va., and was Speaker of the House of Burgesses in
1653. He received two considerable grants of land, one in Warwick,
where he lived, and another on Potomac Creek.</p>

<p class='c009'>The son resided in Middlesex County, Va., and appears to have led
an uneventful life, and to have died unmarried. His will, as that of
“William Whitby, of Pyanketank River in the County of Middlesex,
planter,” was dated July, 1676, and proved July 23, 1677. He gave “to
Major Robert Beverley £100, Mrs. Mary Kibble [Keeble] £100, and my
brother, Joseph Summers £200, all out of a rent due me out of Kent in
England”; John Cocking to have 700 acres, and John Wright 500, both
on Moratico Creek; his land on Potomac Creek to be divided equally
between his brother, Joseph Summers, and Mrs. Mary Kibble, and also
makes a bequest to Thomas Todd. Summers and Beverly, executors.</p>

<p class='c009'>The following chart shows the relationship which would seem from
the records cited to be correct:</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE INFLUENCE OF SLAVERY ON THE OLD SOUTHERN CIVILIZATION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>Now that the “Old South” has passed away as utterly as the ancient
kingdoms of Babylon and Assyria, before the very memory of her
shall have faded from the earth, it may not be without interest to
thoughtful readers to endeavor to trace the cause which produced the striking
dissimilarity between her civilization and that of the Northern States
of the Union. That such dissimilarity existed is beyond dispute; it only
remains, therefore, to attempt to explain it. Beginning National life, as
did the thirteen original colonies, under the same general conditions; with
the heritage of a common origin, a common language, and a common
faith, what influence was it which, within the term of a hundred years, was
potent enough to effect so great a change in the habits, the manners, and
the character of the people of the two sections?</p>

<p class='c009'>Was the institution of Slavery mainly responsible for this result? I
believe that it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>While due allowance must be made for climatic and other local conditions,
the institution of slavery, in its direct and indirect effects upon the
Southern people, appears to be by far the most important factor in the
equation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let us briefly consider the subject. On the colonial history of the
Southern States, it is unnecessary to dwell. Suffice it to say, that while
thoroughly imbued with the spirit of independence and taking a leading
part in the struggle of 1776, in this course the South was actuated by a
desire to assert its abstract rights, and to stand loyally by its sister colonies
of the North, rather than by any personal grievance, or feeling of animosity
towards the Mother Country.</p>

<p class='c009'>Between the Southern States themselves, there were strongly marked
differences, each possessing its own distinctly individual character. But
in essentials, the family likeness between them was strong enough to make
any one member of the group a typical representative of the whole, so far
as the outside world was concerned. Bound indissolubly together by that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>common bond,—the institution of slavery,—in politics they were equally
united. From those early days when the American Government was in
its formative stage, down to the period of the Civil War in 1861, the
South stood always a solid unit for republican principles as imbodied in
the Constitution of the United States, and exemplified in the cardinal
Southern doctrine of “States’ Rights.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The term “democracy” as applied to the South is a total misnomer,
and its application furnishes one of the many curious anomalies to be found
in American political history. But this history is too tangled a skein to be
unravelled here. Enough to say that the Old South was never a democracy,
properly so called; on the contrary, it was an oligarchy of the most
pronounced and exclusive type, its population being sharply divided into
two classes, patrician and plebeian—the governing and the governed. Nay
more, although nominally the entire white population belonged in the first
category (and was therefore eligible for public office), practically the
franchise was confined to the educated and property-holding class alone,
the “poor whites” of the South being too numerically weak and insignificant
to be an appreciable power in politics.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus it came about that, from first to last, in this fundamental particular
the South differed from every other section of the Republic; and this
difference was the direct result of the Institution of Slavery.</p>

<p class='c009'>Secondly: The economic conditions existing at the South were totally
unlike those in other parts of the country. The Old South was, emphatically,
a community of agriculturists; and of all modes of making a livelihood
agriculture is the one least liable to violent fluctuations and sudden
collapse. It is true that in the South wealth never rolled up into the
millions, and, judged by present standards, bank accounts were by no
means imposing in round numbers; but all the real advantages and immunities
that wealth can give were enjoyed by the Southern people who,
as a class, were in possession of an assured income sufficient not only for
the supply of their necessities, but for the gratification of their tastes as
well. And in those days there was a solidity and a stability about men’s
financial affairs which effectually removed from them the pressure of
anxiety for the future, and protected them from that feverish, harassing
mental strain only too well-known elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c009'>And here again, we come face to face with that basal fact—“the
institution”—on which rested the whole industrial system of the South.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>Again: The intimate relation necessarily existing between economic
and social conditions would lead us to infer that conservatism was the great
law of Southern society. And in truth, permanence and continuity were
its most marked characteristics. The fluctuations and vicissitudes which
formed so striking a feature of Northern social life were practically
unknown at the South. From generation to generation, men occupied the
same habitations, pursued the same callings and held the same place in the
community; and, as a rule, the father’s social status determined that of the
son, and the son’s son after him. Thus was created and preserved a
social atmosphere only attainable under these peculiar conditions; and the
effect of such a social environment upon the whole tone of the people may
readily be conceived.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the South, for example, the spirit of commercialism was noticeably
absent. Wealth was not there regarded as the “be all” and the
“end all” of existence—the standard by which to measure the sum of
human achievement. Nor was a money value affixed to the thousand and
one little services passing current in the community. These were regarded
simply as small social courtesies due from neighbor to neighbor, and were
freely rendered and as freely accepted, without a thought of pecuniary
obligation on either side.</p>

<p class='c009'>An equally distinguishing characteristic of Southern society was the
position universally accorded to woman. Southern chivalry has frequently
been made a target for ridicule, as a “survival” from the Dark
Ages; but the elevating and refining influence it exercised upon the public
tone was assuredly a most salutary one. And although, in the light of
later developments, it must be conceded that the old Southern idea of
woman’s helplessness and absolute dependence upon man for support and
protection, savored somewhat of Quixotism, the spirit of knight-errantry
fostered thereby was a wholesome one, in that it acted both as an incentive
to exertion and as an antidote to selfishness. Even the “code of the
duello,” while of course indefensible in principle, had something to be
urged in its favor for, beyond doubt, it exerted a restraining influence
over a hot-blooded people and made for order in the land.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have said that as a political entity the South consisted of two classes—the
governing and the governed. In its social structure, however, it
was far more complex. Tier above tier rose the social pyramid, ever
narrowing as it neared the apex, on which delectable elevation rested those
favored mortals “born in the purple,” placidly secure in their social preeminence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Society, that inevitable product of civilization, is, all the
world over, composed of orders and degrees, but whereas at the North
these several gradations merged almost imperceptibly one into another,
at the South they were divided by very sharply drawn lines of demarcation.
The tradesman, the artisan, the mechanic stood quite apart from
the professional classes and the landed-proprietors. In every age and in
every clime talent will assert itself and rise to the top; and to this rule the
South was no exception. But comparatively speaking, south of Mason
and Dixon’s line there were to be found few “self-made” men, and those
few were almost without exception, men intellectually gifted, who had
climbed the social ladder by the rounds of fame rather than of fortune.</p>

<p class='c009'>This, however, is a digression; our present purpose being, not to
uncover, fold by fold, the inner intricacies of Southern society, but to
present a broad and inclusive view of that society as a whole, and as contrasted
with the society of other sections. Perhaps this may best be done
by treating the subject somewhat in detail.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a recent criticism of a Western poet the reviewer remarked that
whatever the poet’s shortcomings might be, his descriptions of homely
rural life must strike a responsive chord in the hearts of his readers all
over the country, carrying them back to scenes and phases of life with
which in youth they were familiar. Now, as a matter of fact, not a single
one of these allusions could awaken an answering echo in a Southern breast!
Descriptions of farm life with its round of labors performed by the
fanner’s own hands, might be interesting reading enough to the Southerner,
but the interest would be that of novelty not of familiarity. For
never in the days of his youth had he himself “driven the plough,” or
joined as a worker in the jocund mirth of a “harvest home.” Neither
would he recognize in the portraiture of the “village worthies” the companions
of his own youth; and rustic wit and rustic manners were equally
apart from his personal experiences.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not by any means that the lot of the Southern planter was always
easier than that of the Northern farmer. Hard work most generally fell
to his share. Early to rise and late to rest, he toiled as arduously and as
unremittingly as his Northern brother, but the toil was of a different sort.
It consisted not in literally putting his own shoulder to the wheel, but in
training, directing, and supervising the labors of others, and often (hardest
and most harassing work of all) in contriving how to supply the wants
of his numerous dependants. Supreme autocrat within his own domain,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the very consciousness of his power created in him a sense of responsibility,
which produced a strength and gravity of character and a certain dignity
of bearing. Born to control, from his cradle the Southern land owner was
trained to regard himself as the natural protector, provider, and friend of
the weak and the helpless. Thus, while the environment of the Northern
farmer was calculated to make him think first of his own personal needs
and his duty to himself, that of the Southern planter as naturally impressed
upon him the duty he owed to those by whom he was surrounded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was his work. His pleasures consisted chiefly in field-sports—hunting,
fishing, riding, boating—he was usually a keen sportsman and a
capital rider and sometimes, though not so frequently, a great reader as
well.</p>

<p class='c009'>If for the most part not scholars, however, Southern men could at
least generally lay claim to a collegiate education. And whether it was
due to vague recollections of classic lore, and lingering memories of Alma
Mater, or to the tone of the home atmosphere by which they were surrounded
(which is, after all, the truly effective educating influence), certain
it is that, as a rule, their manners were polished and their modes of
expression those of the “classes,” not of the “masses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Southern matron was noted for her administrative rather than
for her executive ability. Not that, generally speaking, her days were
passed in idleness; on the contrary, her life was usually a full and beneficent
one, including not only her domestic avocations—among which may
be mentioned the now well-nigh forgotten accomplishments of cookery and
fine needlework—but the many good offices of a Lady Bountiful which she
graciously dispensed among her numerous dependants; plantation life
affording ample scope for her activities in this direction. But the menial
drudgery of a household did not devolve upon its mistress; and, in consequence,
she had at her command an abundant portion of that leisure which—while
not a <i>sine qua non</i> as regards strictly intellectual acquirement—is
undoubtedly essential to the cultivation of the mental graces. Truth to
say, as a class, Southern women were more distinguished for their soft
femininity and finished refinement of manner than for their erudition.
By which I am far from implying that they ignored grammar; much less
that—in common with their male relatives—they used the negro-dialect.
As a matter of fact indeed, by no people was purer <i>dictionary</i> English
spoken, than by the upper-class in the Old South.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>In its whole internal arrangement and frictionless daily routine the
homelife of the South much more nearly resembled that of the English
gentry, than that of the dwellers in the Northern States of the Union.
Thanks to “the institution,” the household machine was too complex a
mechanism ever to be thrown completely out of gear, the direful domestic
problems so often confronting the Northern housewife being at the South
entirely unknown. And as conditions, homely and trivial in themselves,
sometimes exert an influence on things seemingly beyond their sphere, it
may be that that large hearted, free-handed hospitality for which the Old
South was famed, was in part at least, the result of this feeling of stability
about the domestic foundations.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ANTHONY WALTON WHITE, BRIGADIER IN THE CONTINENTAL ARMY</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c010'>The subject of this memoir descended from an ancient and honorable
West of England family, noted for six generations for its
military predilections. The first Anthony of whom we have particulars
was a zealous partisan of Charles I., and left England for Virginia
after the establishment of the Commonwealth; but, stopping at
Bermuda, decided to remain there, where he became a member of the
Government. The second Anthony returned to England and under
William III. became a lieutenant-colonel and served at the battle of the
Boyne. In reward for services, he was appointed a member of the
King’s council, and Chief Justice of the Bermudas; an office which descended
to his eldest son, Leonard, who entered the British Navy and
served with distinction. The third Anthony, Leonard’s eldest son, came
to New York about 1715, married a Miss Staats, and died soon afterwards,
on the voyage to Bermuda. His only son, Anthony (IV.), after
holding various civil offices in the State of New Jersey, entered the army
and was a lieutenant-colonel in 1751. He married Elizabeth, daughter
of Lewis Morris, governor of New Jersey, by whom he had the subject of
our sketch, Anthony, the fifth of the name—his middle name coming from
his godfather, the celebrated William Walton, of the “Walton House,”
in the present Franklin Square, New York City. Anthony was born July
7, 1750, at the family residence near New Brunswick, N. J.</p>

<p class='c009'>The family aptitude for officeholding secured him, in due time,
several posts of honor and profit under the Crown, and up to the outbreak
of the Revolution he pursued the ordinary routine life of a country gentleman
of large property; when the hereditary love of arms, and a sincere
attachment to the cause of country, transformed him into the ardent
patriot. In October, 1775, he was appointed an aide to Washington,<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c015'><sup>[8]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and in February, 1776, became Lieutenant-Colonel of the Third N. J.
Battalion. In this capacity he was actively engaged in service at the
North until 1780, when he was transferred to the First Regiment of
Cavalry, and ordered South, to assume general command of the cavalry
in that department.</p>

<p class='c009'>In July, 1780, despairing of receiving the promised aid from the
State of Virginia, and anxious to join the army under Gates, then in South
Carolina, Colonel White procured on his own personal credit, the funds
necessary to remount and support for a short time, two regiments; with
which he marched to join Gates—fortunately too late to share in the
defeat at Camden (and yet, that same rout might have been a victory, had
a sufficient force of cavalry been among Gates’ men). In 1781, White
was ordered to Virginia to coöperate with Lafayette’s force against
Cornwallis, and several times skirmished with Tarleton. In the winter
of 1781–2, he was again in the Carolinas, opposed to him; and in the
operations of Wayne at Savannah, May 21, 1782, Colonel White by his
bold and adroit conduct, contributed largely to the success which followed.
After the evacuation of the city by the enemy, he returned to South Carolina,
and entered Charleston, where his noted generosity was exemplified
by his becoming security for the debts of the officers and men of his command,
who were in want of almost all the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>They agreed to repay him in tobacco—then the only currency of any
stable value—which was to be delivered to him at Charleston on a fixed
date. Owing partly to the failure of the crop that year, and partly to the
inability of his beneficiaries to carry out their part of the agreement, he
had to part with a large part of his Northern property, at a ruinous sacrifice.
In the spring of 1783, he was married to Margaret Ellis, a young
girl of only fifteen, but who is described as of remarkable accomplishments,
as well as of wealth and beauty. After the conclusion of hostilities,
he returned to the North and settled in New York City to spend the remainder
of his life, as he hoped, in tranquil enjoyment of well-earned
repose, and regain his former affluence; but was unhappily persuaded by
his old army friends to join them in a speculation which, as the only
responsible member of the organization, nearly ruined him as a result.</p>

<p class='c009'>In 1793 he removed from New York to his native New Brunswick,
where he spent the rest of his life. He was destined, however, to be once
more called to arms; being appointed by Washington, in 1794, to command
the cavalry in the expedition under Henry Lee, against the Western
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>insurgents; in the delicate management of which duty, he not only won the
esteem and gratitude of the inhabitants of the region which was the scene
of the insurrection, but the gratitude even of the prisoners whom he was
obliged to take to Philadelphia. He then petitioned Congress for repayment
of the large sums he had advanced to the State of Virginia—but
unsuccessfully; and though his last years were clouded by the loss of almost
all the wealth which was once his, he endured the reverses of fortune
with the courage of an ancient Roman. His homestead at New Brunswick
was frequently the resort of the leading men of the day—and
Kosciuszko was there nursed through a severe sickness, by the unremitting
care of Mrs. White and her daughter, which he gratefully acknowledged,
in letters still owned by the great-granddaughter of General (as he became)
White, Miss Bellita Evans of New Brunswick. General White
was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c015'><sup>[9]</sup></a> his insignia of which
is now owned by his descendant, Mr. Anthony Walton White Evans.<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c015'><sup>[10]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c009'>General White’s grave, in the cemetery of Christ Church, New
Brunswick, is inscribed:</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Genealogical and Biographical notes on the White Family.</span>
The ancestor of the first Anthony White was sent to Virginia by Raleigh
in 1587, as Governor of his colony. Returning the next year with supplies,
he was defeated by Spanish vessels and obliged to return to England.
In 1590 he found the colony of Roanoke deserted. Leonard
(probably his son), emigrated to Virginia in 1620. Governor White’s
daughter was Virginia Dare, the first white child born in the New World.
One of his brothers, Sir John White, also went to Bermuda, probably in
1609, with Sir George Somers. It was the “terrible tempest” and shipwreck
which dispersed this company which in 1611 suggested to Shakespeare
the play of “The Tempest.” Sir John White married a descendant
of Sir Owen Tudor, the ancestor of Henry VIII. Joanna White,
sister of Anthony Walton, born Nov. 14, 1744, d. s. p. June 26, 1834;
third wife of Col. John Bayard (born Cecil Co., Md., Aug. 11, 1738).
He was a member of the Council of Safety, Speaker of the House of
Representatives, in 1785 a member of the Old Congress in New York.
In 1789 he removed from Philadelphia to New Brunswick; was Mayor
there and Judge of the Common Pleas.</p>

<p class='c009'>He died Jan. 7, 1807, a patriot of spotless life, public and private.
He was the great-great uncle of the late Senator Bayard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Euphemia White, second sister of Anthony, born Dec. 10, 1746, d.
s. p. Jan. 29, 1832; married Hon. William Paterson (born 1745; grad.
N. J. Coll. 1763. Att’y Gen’l of N. J. in 1775; in 1793 nominated by
Washington Associate Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court; in 1794 Governor
of N. J.; died Sept. 9, 1806).</p>

<p class='c009'>The Staats family was originally from Albany. Dr. Abraham
Staes, who came to New Netherlands in 1642, was the ancestor of the
Staats of to-day, the name having been changed soon afterwards to its
present form. Dr. Samuel Staats, son of Major Abraham Staats of
Albany, studied medicine in Holland. When New York was surrendered
to the English, he returned to Holland, and remained until William III.
became King of England, when he returned to New York, and died there
in 1715.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being appointed by the King to a Government post in Java, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>married there a native princess, by whom he had six daughters, all of
whom married. In May, 1709, he again married—Catharine Hawarden,
of New York. Of the nine children which he had in 1703, the first
five were probably born in Java or Holland. The Princess’ six daughters
were: Sarah, married Isaac Gouverneur in 1704. Their daughter Sarah
became the second wife of Colonel Lewis Morris, of Morrisania. The
second daughter married in 1716, Andrew Coejman, of Coejman’s Manor
near Albany, N. Y. The third, Catalina, was baptized, N. Y., June 16,
1689. The fourth, Anna Elizabeth, baptized Dec. 21, 1690, married
Captain Johannes Schuyler. The fifth, Joanna, baptized Jan. 31, 1694,
married in 1716, Col. Anthony White, of Bermuda. Her second husband
was Admiral Norton Kelsall, R. N. The sixth, Tryntje, baptized
April 5, 1697, was first wife of Col. Lewis Morris. His second wife
was thus Tryntje’s own niece. Two sons were born of these two marriages—General
Lewis Morris, the “Signer,” and Gouverneur Morris,
who were half-brothers. Another brother, General Staats Morris,
married in London, Catherine, Dowager-Duchess of Gordon. Their
grandfather, Lewis Morris, was the first Royal Governor of New Jersey
(1738). He married in 1691, a daughter of James Graham, Attorney-General
of New York. The mother of Margaret Ellis was —— Vanderhorst,
sister of Elias Vanderhorst, American Consul at Bristol, England,
in 1780, who is mentioned in “Thaddeus of Warsaw.” The family is
represented in the United States by the descendants of Major Arnoldus
Vanderhorst of Charleston.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Being offer’d a safe conveyance for my letter, I cannot resist the
opportunity of congratulating you, on your enlargement from your Horrible
Dungeon; you are too just, and generous to your Friends, not to
have felt their anguish on your Sufferings, and fear, it was no small aggravation
to <i>them</i>. My exquisite Friend the Duchess Dow<sup>r</sup> of Portland,
took every precaution to conceal, what she with real concern, had heard
was your situation, and during the rigor of it, I was ignorant of what
must have griev’d me very much, as I cannot without shuddering recollect
the inhuman treatment you have met with; most heartily I wish you at
perfect Liberty, among your Friends here; tho it may be presumption in
me, to have any expectation, of sharing the joy such an event would give
them; and shou’d not be surpriz’d, if you started at my well known hand
(tho somewhat the worse for the wear) supposing it a letter rather from
the Dead, than the living; but, it has pleas’d God to Lengthen my Days
to an age which commonly is attended with Labour &#38; Sorrow; of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>latter I have had some share of the most grievous kind that of surviving
many Dear and Valuable Friends; but as I trust they are infinitely happier
than I can possibly be on this turbulent spot, that consoles me and my
spirits are still sufficient to enable me to enjoy my remaining Blessings;
among the Number, The Honourable Station y<sup>r</sup> Excellent Brother Sackville
possesses, the high esteem he is in with every Body that can distinguish
merit &#38; his Domestick and social Happiness must gladden the heart
of all that know him; I say no more of the rest of y<sup>r</sup> familly as I suppose
you have better intelligence from them; my last acc<sup>ts</sup>. were satisfactory of
all. The Death of our ingenious Friend and most excellent woman M<sup>rs</sup>.
Ham<sup>n</sup> of Summer Hill had been so long expected from the severity of a
long illness that her release was rather to be wished tho her loss must be
lamented. I have felt much for her good Daughter who I fear has not
so cordial a Friend in her Brother as she truly deserves; her Mother has
taken care to leave her in comfortable and independent circumstanse.
Your constant Friend M<sup>rs</sup> Sandford has supported a very delicate state
of health, marvellously, and gone thus far with great success in the Education
of her 4 fine Sons; she has been very unhappy ab<sup>t</sup> you as she heard
how inhumanly yu had been treated—I know if she was at my Elbow I
shou’d be charged with her affectionate complim<sup>ts</sup> and wishes to <i>her</i> old
Friend Harry, and think if you were to meet you wou’d still recollect <i>your</i>
old Friend Pooney.</p>

<p class='c009'>And now it might become me to apologize for so long a letter; but
that would be meer ceremony for I know your good heart too well not to
suppose even so imperfect an account of your Friends will be welcome, I
therefore add before I conclude, that my three Nephews are well tho not
all Happy, my Bro<sup>r</sup> Dewes died last summer and has left his Eldest Son
in good circumstances,—my Nephew Bern<sup>d</sup> was the Happiest of Men till
deprived some months ago of a most amiable wife; my 3<sup>d</sup> Nephew has not
a wish to make being the Husband of an agreeable worthy wife settled to
their hearts’ content at Calwich. My Niece M<sup>rs</sup> Port mother of 6 Children
and consequently full of Parental anxieties but well in health—you
see by trespassing so much on your Friend<sup>p</sup> how confident I am of it—will
you hazard a letter to me? if waves and wind are favourable I may
receive it—please God,—before my 82d year is compleated; and, if not
by that time superannuated, it will give sincere pleasure to Dear S<sup>r</sup></p>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>Dear Sir</i>:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I have just returned to my office from the house of Mr. Washburn,
where I had the honor to meet Madame de Lesseps,—an honor and
pleasure wholly unexpected to me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I went to see Mr. Washburn for the purpose of conferring with him
in relation to yourself and the great International Canal through the
Isthmus of Panama.</p>

<p class='c009'>Mr. Washburn was absent. But Mrs. Washburn very kindly invited
me to stay and lunch with them. As we had been in Congress twelve
years together, he in the House, and I in the Senate from Wisconsin, and
as our families were so well acquainted at Washington, I could not decline
her invitation, especially as it would give me such an opportunity to make
the acquaintance of your excellent wife.</p>

<p class='c009'>But what I wanted to say to Mr. Washburn and have him join me in
saying to you, is thus: I am not satisfied with the Message of President
Hayes upon the subject of the Isthmus routes.</p>

<p class='c009'>While I am, as an American citizen, prepared to stand by the Monroe
doctrine, so far as it opposes the <i>control</i> of these routes by Great Britain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>or any other power, I do not think the Monroe doctrine goes so far as to
assert that we as the great Republic of the New World propose to take the
control into our hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>While we may be more interested in that route than any other nation,
we cannot assert for ourselves what we are unwilling to allow to other
nations,—the domination of the route, which, from its position on the
earth, of right belongs to all mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>So long as we assert the doctrine of President Monroe we stand upon
the defensive. We stand for the freedom of the seas. Our policy, our
traditions, our arms will maintain that.</p>

<p class='c009'>But if we assert the doctrine of President Hayes, we leave the ground
on which Monroe stood and upon which our people would stand solid,
even to the point of war, and we place ourselves in antagonism to the very
idea which makes the Monroe Doctrine strong among our own people, and
strong throughout the world.</p>

<p class='c009'>If we follow Mr. Hayes, instead of defending the freedom of the
seas we dominate the Isthmus ourselves, and lay our hands upon the commerce
of the World.</p>

<p class='c009'>When this subject comes to be discussed, calmly (but I fear that cannot
be until the next President election is over), the sound sober thought
of our people will repudiate this new departure of Mr. Hayes, and will
sustain the Monroe Doctrine, in its true meaning, viz:</p>

<p class='c009'>That the routes across the Isthmus, between North and South
America, shall not pass under the domination of any foreign power to levy
tribute upon our commerce nor upon the commerce of any other nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Isthmus of Panama, the Isthmus of Suez, and the Bosphorus,
ought to be free channels of commerce to all nations in peace, and in war;
and no less in war than in peace. And the law of nations should provide
that if any nation shall attempt to close or blockade them in peace <i>or in
war</i>, that nation should be treated as having made war upon the commerce
of all other nations.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I go to my home in Wisconsin this evening and shall not be able
to meet you, I beg to say that I hope you will not be discouraged in your
great work. The people of America will be in sympathy with you, upon
the basis that no control shall ever be permitted to any government, and
that its freedom shall be guaranteed by the civilized nations, both in peace
and in war.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE MAGAZINE OF AMERICAN HISTORY</h2>
</div>

<p class='c022'>Which was founded in 1877, ceased to appear in 1893, not long after the death of
Mrs. <span class='sc'>Martha J. Lamb</span>, who had then been its editor for nearly ten years; and has
never since been equalled, until the present time. A legal obstacle preventing the
word “American” in connection with the title, the present Magazine will bear
the name of</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div><span class='sc'>The Magazine of History, with Notes and Queries.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(The latter phrase formed a part of the title of the Magazine of American History
in 1880, and is adopted as peculiarly descriptive of an important part of the new
publication.)</p>

<p class='c009'>The Publisher (who will act as Editor for the present) desires it to be understood
that this difference in title does not indicate any difference in the character or
contents of the Magazine. It will be as near an exact duplicate of the original
Magazine of American History in form, size—even in type,—as is possible, while
the character and scope of its contents will be the same as won for the former in the
past such approval as is found in the following paragraphs, taken from many such
in one year:</p>

<p class='c014'>“This periodical is without a rival in its domain, and is becoming indispensable to all
intelligent readers. It is an unfailing source of historical and documentary evidence of the
growth and expansion of our vast country.”—<cite>Christian Advocate.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“It is more than a periodical; it gathers into permanent and accessible form material that
would otherwise be lost, or only found with great effort. Its articles are uniformly well
written, and the illustrations and print complete the attractiveness of the magazine.”—<cite>New
York Commercial Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“This magazine is one of the best periodicals in America.”—<cite>New York Tribune.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“It is always a pleasure to welcome the <span class='sc'>Magazine of American History</span>, with its antiquarian
interest, its historical and biographical value, its fine type and paper, and its antique
illustrations.”—<cite>Brooklyn Eagle.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“Each number presents an admirable collection of papers, and maintains the high
character of the gifted editor, who, in her history of New York city, displayed the highest
qualities of an author. The magazine is as instructive as it is entertaining.”—<cite>Scientific
American.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“This publication has steadily increased in interest. It fills a niche of its own, and fills
it so admirably as to ward off any attempt at competition.”—<cite>Baltimore American.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“The editor is giving great dignity to our country in recording the lives of families that
are noble in the highest sense.”—<cite>Boston Globe.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“This periodical richly deserves the high rank accorded to it by leading historical scholars
in the two hemispheres.”—<cite>Boston Transcript.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“It is crowded with facts of historical interest. The editor is remarkably at home with
her subject, and her selections are made with a thorough appreciation of the wants of her
readers.”—<cite>Manufacturers’ Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“It is beyond all question the most admirable historical periodical published. It is filled
with articles prepared after long research by prominent students of history, and original documents
never before published appear from time to time, adding to its value.”—<cite>Detroit Commercial
Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p class='c014'>“It is rich in illustration and its make-up is of the highest order. Its articles are on
subjects of real interest and value to all students of American history.”—<cite>Westminster Teacher.</cite></p>

<p class='c009'>In the February number will appear an interesting Lincoln article, by Mr. F.
E. Stevens, author of “The Black Hawk War.” It will be illustrated with two
heretofore unknown portraits of contemporaries of Mr. Lincoln. There will also
be a valuable article by Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, on “Some Popular Myths of
American History,” which will also contain an unpublished letter of Washington’s
of peculiar interest.</p>

<p class='c009'>A specific department—of Genealogy—not found in the M. A. H. will be added
to the others, under the able care of Mr. William Prescott Greenlaw, the well-known
Librarian of the New England Historic Genealogic Society. This will
afford an excellent opportunity for such queries, which are usually inserted only in
periodicals issued at much longer intervals than monthly.</p>

<p class='c009'>During the next six months there will appear a series of articles on the Progress
of Discovery of the Mississippi River, by Mr. Warren Upham, Secretary of the
Minnesota Historical Society—as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>1. The Voyage of Vespucci past the mouths of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c009'>2. De Soto and Moscoso on the Mississippi, 1541–3.</p>

<p class='c009'>3. The expedition of Oñate, 1601.</p>

<p class='c009'>4. Groseillers and Radisson, 1655–6 and 1660; besides a variety of other articles,
covering the whole field of our country’s history; and a number of articles of less
length, from the various writers who have offered their assistance to make the
Magazine as interesting and valuable as its title and aim demand.</p>

<p class='c009'>All that is necessary to insure the permanence of this most valuable publication
is a hundred subscriptions, in addition to those pledged or already received. Towards
this consummation, the various institutions of learning, as well as the old
subscribers, are requested to lend their aid. Specimen copies will be sent on receipt
of the price, 50 cents. Address the publisher.</p>

<p class='c009'>The publication of this, the first number, has been delayed by having to change
printers at the last moment; but after the March number shall have appeared, it
is expected to publish regularly before the 15th of each month.</p>

to Holmes Whitman in 1768, but this
Comfort proves to have been a girl, and
Holmes Whitman, her husband. The

<p class='c009'>The Honorable, the Continental Congress,
having lately passed a Resolve,
contained in the following words, to
wit:—“That two persons be sent at
the expense of the Colonies to Nova
Scotia, to inquire into the state of that
Colony, the disposition of the inhabitants
towards the American cause and the
condition of the fortifications, dockyards,
the quantity of the warlike stores and the
number of soldiers, sailors, and ships of
war there and to transmit the earliest
intelligence to Gen. Washington.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I do hereby constitute and appoint you
the said Moses Child to be one of the
persons to undertake this business, and
as the season is late and this a work of
great importance, I entreat and request
that you will use the utmost despatch,
attention and fidelity in the execution of
it. The necessity of acting with a proper
degree of caution and secrecy is too apparent
to need recommendation. You
will keep an accurate account of your expenses,
and upon your return you will be
rewarded in a suitable manner for the
fatigue of your journey and the service
you render your country by conducting
and discharging the business with expedition
and fidelity. Given under my hand
this 24th day of November, 1775.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not many families can expect the publication
of their genealogies under more
favorable auspices. Mr. William T. R.
Marvin, the joint-author, printer and publisher
of this book, inherited the traditions
of his art, and his taste for genealogical
studies from his father, who, nearly half a
century ago, printed a genealogy of the Marvins.
A comparison of that little duodecimo
of 56 pages with this later volume shows the
marked progress made during the last half
century in the arts of compiling and printing
family histories. The vital details of all
branches of the family, beginning with the
English ancestry and extending through nine
generations in America have been gathered
with scrupulous care, and the biographical
memoranda presented have been selected with
discrimination. The arrangement of the data,
the illustrations, the complete index, and all
of the details of book-making are such as one
would expect from an educated man, having
a deep interest in the subject and a lifelong
experience as a genealogist and a printer.
This book may well be taken for a model by
anyone contemplating the publication of a
genealogy....</p>

<h3 class='c011'>THE STEBBINS GENEALOGY</h3>

<p class='c024'><span class='sc'>By Ralph Stebbins Greenlee
and Robert Lemuel Greenlee</span>.
In two volumes. Chicago,
Illinois. Privately printed, 1904.
4to. 1386 pages.</p>

<p class='c009'>These two magnificent volumes are devoted
to Rowland Stebbins (who died at Northampton,
Mass. December 14, 1671), and his
descendants. A study of the name in England
is presented, but no positive connection of the
immigrant is shown. The compilation was
made under the direction of a Chicago genealogist,
Mr. Edward A. Claypool, and the
work was printed in Chicago. Both compilation
and printing seem to be very well done.
One of the first genealogies printed in New
England (1771) was of a branch of this family.
The paper used is of an excellent quality,
and, while the size and weight of these massive
volumes is against durability, it is probable
that they will long survive many of the
genealogies of recent years where little or no
care has been exercised in the selection of
paper.</p>

<p class='c009'>All of the descendants of the hardy pioneer
settler of the Connecticut Valley, whose race
furnished a pioneer genealogist, have good
reasons to be thankful to the Messrs. Greenlee
for their splendid history of the family.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR 1905</h2>
</div>

<p class='c022'>I expect to publish within the coming twelve months several interesting
items of Americana, viz:</p>

<p class='c014'>I.—<span class='sc'>The History of the Second Company, Governor’s Foot-Guard</span> of the
State of Connecticut; by Jason Thomson, Esq., of the New Haven Bar (a
member of the Company). This was originally issued as a pamphlet, but
has long been out of print. The Company is the third oldest military
organization in the United States, beginning its history with service in the
Revolution when Benedict Arnold, its first captain, took the Colony powder
by force from the hesitant Selectmen of New Haven, and marched to
Cambridge, accompanied by Israel Putnam, to join the patriot forces
there. It has since served in the War of 1812, the War of the Rebellion,
and the Spanish-Cuban War. The history of such an organization is
obviously well worth preserving and enlarging by illustrations, as I have
done. It will contain:</p>

<p class='c014'>1. A rare plate of Benedict Arnold, in uniform, as he appeared before
<i>Quebec</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>2. A colored plate, showing the present uniform of the Company.</p>

<p class='c014'>3. A most interesting reproduction of a document of unique interest—the
original manuscript petition to the Assembly of Connecticut, praying
for the incorporation of the Company. This is signed by all the original
members of the Company, including Arnold and his brother-in-law, Pierpont
Edwards, who afterwards, by the irony of Fate, became the executor
of his estate, at the discovery of his treason.</p>

<p class='c014'>The original is owned by the New Haven Colony Historical Society,
and will be reproduced, not by engraving, but by an actual photograph—folding
to fit the size of the page. The edition will be limited to 250 copies,
of which 248 will be for sale.</p>

<p class='c014'>200 will be octavo (6 × 9) gilt top, bound in cloth. $3.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>50 will be large paper, bound in boards, 8 × 11, untrimmed edges, gilt
top, special paper. $5.00.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Postage extra on each.</i></p>

<p class='c014'>The printing will be from type, distributed as soon as the work has been
done, and this edition will never be duplicated.</p>

<p class='c009'>II.—<span class='sc'>The Poems of Edward Coate Pinkney.</span> With a biographical sketch of
of the poet, by Eugene L. Didier, author of a “Life of Edgar A. Poe,”
“Life of Madame Bonaparte,” etc. The original edition of these poems
is now one of the rarest items of Americana. It was published in 1825,
and won the admiration of the chief American critics, Poe among them,
who pronounced Pinkney to be “the first of American lyrists,” and his
poem, “<cite>A Health</cite>,” (of which I give two verses herewith) “especially
<a id='t58'></a>beautiful—full of spirit and brilliancy.”</p>

      <div class='line in2'>As one may see the burthened bee forth issue from the rose.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Only Pinkney’s untimely death—before he was twenty-five—prevented
his becoming one of the foremost poets of our country. The <cite>North American
Review</cite>, then the highest literary authority in the country, said: “If
the name of Thomas Carew or Sir John Harrington had been attached to
these poems, we should, in all probability, like others, have been completely
taken in.” Another critic declared: “Some of his poems are not
surpassed by any similar productions in the English language.” I risk
nothing in saying that Pinkney’s readers of 1905 will re-echo these
praises—and I trust all who have heretofore sustained me in my historical
publications will give as hearty support to this, my first effort in the field
of American poetry. The edition will consist of 250 copies, of which 200
will be in octavo (6 × 9) form, gilt top, uncut edges, at $3.00.</p>

<p class='c009'>50 copies, on special paper, large paper (8 x 11). $5.00.</p>

<p class='c009'><i>Postage extra on each.</i></p>

Provinces.</span> By Charles Lanman, author of <cite>A Dictionary of Congress</cite>, <cite>The
Private Life of Daniel Webster</cite>, etc., etc. With an Appendix by Lieut.
Campbell Hardy, Royal Artillery.</p>

<p class='c014'>2 vols., octavo. 500 pp. each. Illustrated. Portrait, and memoir of
the author by William Abbatt. Price $10.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>Large paper (8 x 11) 3 vols. (consecutive paging), special fine paper.
Only 15 copies. $20.00.</p>

<p class='c014'>Originally published in 1857, this most valuable and interesting work
has long been out of print and scarce, and hence not known to the present
day as its merits deserve.</p>

<p class='c014'>While other books on similar subjects have been issued since, I think
none of them—or all combined—equal this, as a record not alone of
sport, but of travel, description of scenery, literature and legend (for the
author has recorded many most beautiful Indian legends). The range of
his journeys was from Florida to Labrador, and from the Atlantic to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>present St. Paul and Minneapolis. His style needs no encomium from me.

in a collected form. I have read parts of them as they were published separately, and
the great pleasure derived from the perusal makes me desirous of having the whole in
my possession. They carry us into the fastnesses of our mountains, the depth of our
forests, the watery wilderness of our lakes and rivers, giving us pictures of savage life
and savage tribes, Indian legends, fishing and hunting anecdotes, the adventures of
trappers and backwoodsmen; our whole arcanum, in short, of indigenous poetry and
romance: to use a favorite phrase of the old discoverers, “they lay open the secrets of
the country to us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I return you thanks for the delightful entertainment which your Summer rambles

Alexander Garden, was Major in Lee’s Legion—and his work is one of
the best on its theme. The first volume was published at Charleston, in
1822; the second in 1824. Each is scarce and valuable, the second particularly
so. I propose revising the text, to eliminate errors, and to issue
my edition in two octavo volumes (6 x 9) with a number of illustrations,
including one or more of the author, and one each of the brothers Pinckney

<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In all probability that bullet saved Quebec. Had Arnold not been disabled, his energy
and daring would have successfully carried through the attack on the second barricade.</p>

<p class='c009'>All his subsequent history shows this.</p>

<p class='c009'>The attack on Quebec failed from four causes: the extraordinary inclemency of the
weather, the death of Montgomery, the precipitate retreat by order of Lieut.-Col. Campbell,
who was next in rank, and the disabling of Arnold.</p>

<p class='c009'>The first was contributory only, and the second would not have been conclusive but for
Campbell—an officer of whose subsequent career absolutely nothing appears of record.</p>

<p class='c009'>The fourth was the deciding blow. Even Morgan lacked the decision which would have
led Arnold to carry the (second) barricade at all hazards—and that carried, the third must
have fallen and with it the city. Had Arnold so much as suspected Morgan’s inaction, it is
certain he would have remained in the field, and personally directed the assault in which he
could not join.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was his first and last failure. Valcour Island, Saratoga, Ridgefield—all exhibit the
vigor of him of whom Mr. Codman justly remarks: “Arnold, with the exception of Ethan
Allen, seems beyond all others, to have understood the value of rapid action at the beginning
of (he might have said, throughout) a war.—<span class='sc'>Ed.</span></p>

thus: “But we hope Great Brittaine &#38; the other Powers of Europe may mediate and divert
the War with which we are alarm’d &#38; conclude it in a happy and lasting Peace, and this we
believe in as much as your Excell<sup>y</sup> doth not mention in your Speech that the advice you rec<sup>d</sup>
in the last ships was from the ministry of Great Brittaine who this House apprehends would
have sent forward their Directions had they conceived any immediate Danger of a War.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. December 3, 1730, the House passed acts for raising £6000 for the repair of Fort
William and Mary and for building a state house, and for removing three of the courts of
general quarter sessions of the peace and the inferior courts of common pleas from Portsmouth
to Exeter, Hampton, and Dover. The same day the governor in council approved the act for
removing the courts, but no action was taken on the money bill.</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The same day, March 10, the governor, in anger, dissolved the assembly, intending
thereby “to give his Maj<sup>ties</sup> good subjects an opportunity of sending such to represent them
in the next Assembly as will do all in their Power to retrieve the Injustice you have practiced
in not paying the Publick Debts; and those that will promote peace &#38; a good agreem<sup>t</sup> amongst
all Branches of the Legislature.”</p>

which had been in controversy for many years, and was then in an acute stage. See the

1775; Lieutenant-Colonel Third Battalion, First Establishment, February 9, 1776; Lieutenant-Colonel
Fourth Regiment Light Dragoons, Continental Army, February 13, 1777; (this
regiment appears to have performed its services mostly in the South, where the commanding
officer achieved a national reputation as a brilliant cavalry leader); Lieutenant-Colonel

<p class='c009'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. Mrs. Lamb, in her “History of the City of New-York,” gives an account of the
grand procession three days before the adoption of the Federal Constitution by New
York, July 23, 1788 (the State Convention did not adopt it till July 26): “Mounted on a
fine gray horse, elegantly caparisoned, and led by two negroes in oriental costume, Anthony
Walton White bore the arms of the United States in sculpture, preceding the Society of the
Cincinnati, in full uniform.”</p>

<p class='c009'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. The insignia is that once owned by Kosciuszko, who exchanged his own with Gen.
White, on the occasion of his return to the United States in 1798. Thus there is now in
the possession of Mr. Evans the identical badge which was worn by the brave Pole on the
battlefields of Poland in 1794, where as history tells us he rivalled Washington in his strategy
and intrepidity, though alas, not in the ultimate success of his patriotic cause.</p>

wonder of the day, and the latter, with Dr. John Jeffries, of Boston, had just made the first
crossing of the Channel to France, in a balloon.</p>
